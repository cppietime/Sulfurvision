I'm making this little project to try to generate some nice fractals in Python, hopefully using the GPU effectively.

Steps remaining:

- (De)Serialization
- Interpolation between Transforms
- Python-side data structures
- OpenCL:

  - Detect and choose device
  - Discover available memory and capabilities
  - Device-side structures
  - Port each variation function
  - Write actual kernel
